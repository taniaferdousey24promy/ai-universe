            <h3>Ques-2: How to select HTML elements from DOM ?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer: </strong>By the following 5 ways we can select elements in a DOM using selectors.
            </p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong>getElementById()</strong>= gives one specific element by the element_id.
                </li>
                <li><strong>getElementByTagName()</strong>= gives all the elements by simillar class name.
                </li>
                <li><strong>getElementByClassName()</strong>= gives mentioned  tag elements together  .
                </li>
                <li><strong>querySelector</strong>= returns only first element which gets matched with the selector.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>querySelectorAll</strong>= returns a node list matched with specific selector.

            <h3>Ques-4: What is Call-Back Function and how does it work ?</h3>
            <p>Answer: A callback function is a function that receives an argument from another function and is then called inside the outer function to execute a task or action.Asynchronous callbacks, on the other hand, are callbacks that are frequently used to carry on code execution after an asynchronous operation has ended.</p>
